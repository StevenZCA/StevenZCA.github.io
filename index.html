                This React-ified UI is implemented with a parent container GameComponent and its two children
                BoardComponent. Both React components maintain there own React component State and React component properties.
                The Parent component passes properties to Child component as well as a callback function defined in parent component
                that is triggered when Child component's componentDidUpdate event.

                The core algorithm is written based on Peter Norvig http://norvig.com/ Sudoku solver algorithm. Besides that I have 
                done comprehensive research on the best algorithm that includes backtracking, dancing links, algorithm X etc. In 
                the end. I've decided to leverage Peter Norvig algorithm since the average computation time is closer to the best
                known JavaScript implementations online.

                   Overall, the JavaScript implementations on browsers are slower than those done by Python or C++ ones.
